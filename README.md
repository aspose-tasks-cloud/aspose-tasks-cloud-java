# Manipulate MS Project Files in Java via Cloud REST API

Aspose.Tasks for Cloud offers the ability to manipulate and convert Microsoft Project MPT, MPP, MPX & Oracle Primavera XER, XML, and PrimaveraP6XML files in Java. [Aspose.Tasks Cloud SDK for Java](https://products.aspose.cloud/tasks/java) wraps the REST API to make it easier for the developers to integrate MS Project Task Management features in their own cloud-based Java applications on Linux, MacOS, Windows or Android.

Feel free to explore the [Developer's Guide](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/taskscloud/Developer+Guide) & [API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/tasks/) to know all about Aspose.Tasks Cloud API.

## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in this repository folder. You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [Maven](https://repository.aspose.cloud/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-tasks-cloud) (recommended). For more details, please visit our [documentation website](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/taskscloud/Available+SDKs).

### Prerequisites

To use Aspose Tasks Cloud SDK for Java you need to register an account with [Aspose Cloud](https://www.aspose.cloud/) and lookup/create App Key and SID at [Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps). There is free quota available. For more details, see [Aspose Cloud Pricing](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing).

## Installation & Usage

```

## Convert MS Project MPP to PDF in Java

```java
        // Start README example

        // if baseUrl is null, TasksApi uses default https://api.aspose.cloud 
        TasksApi tasksApi = new TasksApi(clientId, clientSecret, baseUrl);

        String localPath = PathUtil.get(localFolder, fileName);
        String remotePath = PathUtil.get(remoteFolder, remoteName);

        UploadFileRequest uploadRequest = new UploadFileRequest(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(localPath)), remotePath, null);
        tasksApi.uploadFile(uploadRequest);
		
        GetReportPdfRequest request = new GetReportPdfRequest(remoteFileName, ReportType.MILESTONES.getValue(), null, null);
        File result = tasksApi.getReportPdf(request);
		

        // End README example
```
